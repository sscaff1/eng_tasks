# Background
This application is a Task Management application similar to Toggl. It allows uses to job on and off tasks in order to track their time. The user is also permitted to apply time manually. Users can assign different roles and work in teams on project. This application is currently being used by small OEM to track their engineer's time and assign costs to projects. The application works, but it's not perfect. I do NOT intend to update this application further. The application is coded in CakePHP version 2.X. Let me know if you have any questions.
